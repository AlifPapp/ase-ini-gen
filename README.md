## About
In the video game Ark: Survival Evolved, you're able to change your visual settings further by altering an `.ini` file in the game's program files.
Most players skip editing the `.ini` because it is confusing and tedious, so they swap in various presets and lose access to finer tweaks. This site turns those hard-to-reach settings into a simple, menu-style interface: read a short description, flip a toggle, and build the exact visuals you want in seconds.

## Features:
* Easy, fast, intuitive configuration, copy to clipboard.
* If no exact preview image matches your configuration, the closest available one is shown.
* Within the settings, paste your edited/made `generator.json` and `preview.json` to change what options, descriptions and previews are shown.
* `.ini` to `generator.json` converter to ease your creation of your own `generator.json`


## Notes: 
* The preview images have not been collected.
* Currently, the generator configuration is based on this Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARK/comments/l7zbct/ark_ini_evolved_best_settings_for_pvp/)
